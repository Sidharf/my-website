        <h2>Research @ Dewpoint Therapeutics</h2>
        <p>Drug discovery is steeped in dogma and assumptions. Biologists from different backgrounds (ie. Subdiscipline/ technology) think cells work differently, meaning that the aforementioned dogma is actually quite fragmented! The opportunity that I see in drug discovery is to use high throughput data generation to harmonize valuable subdisciplines and eliminite those that are harmful. With patients in mind, our industry should be focused on redirecting resources to the approaaches that are truly the best suited for drug making (not all of them are). Hope you'll enjoy reading the essays and presentations shared on my website, which offer a window into my views and learnings.</p>
